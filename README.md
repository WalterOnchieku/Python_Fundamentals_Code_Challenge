PYTHON FUNDAMENTALS CODE CHALLENGE
The goal of this challenge is to evaluate understanding of fundamental Python concepts.
There are nine files, each for every question given in the challenge:

- add_numbers.py  
- is_even.py   
- count_vowels.py  
- reverse_string.py  
- sort_by_age.py  
- calculate_factorial.py  
- apply_decorator.py  
- merge_dicts.py  
- car.py  

comments are added to explain what each function does.

To execute the files, open the terminal by pressing (ctrl + `) then type 'python' followed by the filename and the .py extension. then press Enter.

REPOSITORY SETUP
a github repo was created using the following steps :
in the github page, I created a new repo by clicking on the + button and selecting new repository in the dropdown. In the page that follows, I named the new repo and clicked the 'create repository' button at the bottom. after that, I navigated to the folder containing the solutions in the Ubuntu terminal and entered the following commands:

- git init
- git add README.md
- git commit -m "first commit"
- git branch -M main
- git remote add origin git@github.com:WalterOnchieku/Python_Fundamentals_Code_Challenge.git
- git push -u origin main

the new repository was successfully created and pushed to Github.
